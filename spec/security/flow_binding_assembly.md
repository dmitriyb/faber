# Data flow: Binding assembly flow

The per-step path from resolved config to the security slice of a `docker
run` argv, plus the hooks that bracket the container's life.

              Assembled{Args, SecretsStdin, Teardown}

                            │         SecretsStdin streamed on stdin, -i)
                            │  run, wait, capture
                            ▼
              Assembled.Teardown  ── reverse order, always:
                                     kill agent + remove socket
                                     (file mode: nothing — tmpfs dies
                                      with the container)
```

## Shapes at each boundary

| Boundary | Shape | Contract |
|----------|-------|----------|
| step -> Binding | `StepSpec` | resolved values only; bindings never read YAML or the IR |
| Binding -> BindingSet | `Contribution{Args, Teardown}` | args internally ordered; teardown idempotent-once or nil |
| resolver -> broker | `Secret` on stdout | opaque, redacted formatting; non-zero exit = step failure |
| broker -> BindingSet | `Contribution.Secrets` (name→Secret) | file-mode tokens only; encoded once into `Assembled.SecretsStdin` |
| BindingSet -> ContainerRunner | `Assembled{Args, SecretsStdin, Teardown}` | fragment consumed verbatim; `SecretsStdin` streamed on stdin; the only docker-run assembly point is infra's |
| teardown -> caller | joined error or nil | every hook attempted; detached context so cancellation cannot skip it |

## Error paths

Assembly is fail-fast across bindings but complete within teardown: the
first `Prepare` error stops assembly, unwinds already-prepared bindings in
reverse, and surfaces as a structured step failure (failure module's
record) naming the binding — no container was launched, so there is
nothing else to clean. After a launched container exits (any status, or
kill-on-cancel), teardown runs exactly once; its errors are reported on
the step but do not overwrite the step's own result.

## Who runs it

The pipeline executor invokes the flow once per step *attempt*: retry
discards the previous `Assembled` entirely and re-prepares — fresh agent,
fresh resolver call, fresh secrets payload — so between-attempt cleanup can
assume nothing survives an attempt. Nothing in this flow is shared across
steps; parallel steps assemble concurrently against disjoint scratch
directories and sockets. `faber validate` does not run this flow (it is
run-time by nature) but the loader has already proven the config slices
well-formed: exclusive host-key modes, known credential modes, declared
identities.
